# Employee Healthcare Benefits

One of the critical functions that we provide for our clients is the ability to pay for their employees’ healthcare benefits
package. A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, and we handle that deduction. Create a front-end
application that displays the total cost of their healthcare benefits package per paycheck.

## Calculation breakdown:
• The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
• Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year
• Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent

## Assumptions:
• All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions.
• There are 26 paychecks in a year.

## Requirements:
• Mock out an API for the retrieval of employee/dependent data
• Tip: All data can be stored client-side in memory
• List out the employee and their dependents
• Allow the user to change their elections and display a preview of the calculated benefits
• CRUD functionality
• I.E Add/edit employee + dependents
• Allow the user to save their changes and reflect them on subsequent page loads

## Getting Started

First install the required node modules by executing the below cmd

### `npm install`

Now start the program by using the below cmd

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
